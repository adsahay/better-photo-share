{"body":"### Welcome to Better Photo Share (BPS)\r\n\r\nAlthough the name is lame, the idea isn't. The goal is to make photo posts in Tumblr appear big and beautiful in Facebook, instead of tiny thumbnails. Since I love posting my photography on social media, the appearance is important. \r\n\r\nI've made a request to Tumblr to bake this into their Facebook sharing app for **photo** and **photo-set** posts, in a way similar to Instagram or Pinterest. Till that happens, I plan to use my own app.","note":"Don't delete this file!
